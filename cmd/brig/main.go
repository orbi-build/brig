// Command brig runs a coding agent in a sandbox.
//
// The sandbox is a microVM on macOS and a container on Linux, and brig is
// neither: it resolves your credentials on the host, forwards them in per
// exec, mounts a workspace as the agent's home, verifies the guest image, and
// delegates every mechanical operation to hull or nerdctl underneath. The
// product logic lives in internal/wrap and is shared by both, so the two
// operating systems cannot drift apart.

A <ref> is the session. claude is that agent's default session, and
claude@refactor is a session of its own, with its own guest home and its own
sandbox. The label selects the guest home and the sandbox name for every
agent. brig run also passes it to claude-code as its display name. A label
brig would have to rewrite is refused rather than rewritten. brig ls prints
the ref of every sandbox, and every verb above takes one.

global flags (left of the command, as in: brig -q run claude):
      --verbose          the execution envelope, brig's own progress and the
                         runtime's own output. No short form: -v belongs to
                         the agents
  -q, --quiet            identifiers and errors only, for a script. It drops
                         brig's warnings; with ls it prints the refs, one per
                         line. A verification that did not hold is printed
                         even here
                         (-q after the verb works until v0.4.0)
      --json             machine-readable output, for the read verbs: ls, info,
                         plan, agent ls, secret ls, doctor, version and the
                         network verbs. Also accepted after the verb (brig ls
                         --json). Every other verb refuses it
      --json (with run)  run the agent as a child and, after it exits, print one
                         JSON line with its exit status, so a script can tell
                         "brig refused" from "the agent failed"
Within one apiVersion the JSON only ever gains fields, never renames or drops
one, and no field carries a credential value. A script written against it
keeps parsing, and a machine-readable dump stays a place a secret cannot leak.

flags (before the agent's own arguments; -- ends brig's parsing):
      --image IMAGE      guest image to boot
      --home PATH        host directory to mount as the guest home
                         (-w and --workspace still work, with a note)
      --no-project       with run or plan: this session's project is not
                         mounted, whatever it ran with last
      --mem MB           guest memory
      --cpus N           guest vCPUs
  -d, --detach           with run: start the sandbox and exit
      --skills           copy your own ~/.claude skills and plugins into the
                         guest home; the host copy is never written
                         (or BRIG_SKILLS=1)
      --network MODE     shared, isolated or offline (or BRIG_NETWORK)
      --offline          shorthand for --network offline: the agent runs, the
                         workspace is there, nothing leaves
      --publish PORT     open a guest port on the host. Repeatable. No short
                         form: -p belongs to the agents

A published port is 3000 (the same port on both sides), 8080:80 (a host port
and the guest port behind it), 127.0.0.1:8080:80 (an explicit host address) or
5353:53/udp. It binds to 127.0.0.1 unless the address says otherwise, so the
port is reachable from this machine and not from the network this machine is
on. Every one of them is named in the execution envelope. A port stays with
the sandbox until brig network unpublish, so a later run offers it again.

By default a run prints what you have to act on, then the agent: warnings,
errors, and one line saying verification held. The execution envelope, brig's
own progress and the runtime's output wait for --verbose. A boot that fails
quotes what the runtime said whether or not you asked. brig info prints the
envelope on demand, without booting anything.

The sandbox keeps running between commands, so a second run is immediate.
The guest home is a host directory. It survives brig stop, and brig rm
deletes it unless you named it with --home or BRIG_WORKSPACE.

Any Linux CLI in an OCI image runs under brig, if the image also carries the
utilities brig uses to set the sandbox up and deliver the credential: a shell
(sh and bash), plus cat, stat, chown, mkdir, mount and /bin/true. A stock
distro image has them; a scratch image with only your binary does not. An
agent entry just saves you spelling out the image and its credential variables
every time: copy the closest one and edit it, with
  brig agent new mine --from claude, then brig agent edit mine
Building an image for one is documented at

An agent brig ships is built in and has no file. new gives you a copy that
does, under a name of your own and with that name written into it, so
` + "`brig agent edit`" + ` and ` + "`brig run`" + ` both reach it by the name you picked.

A destination is a name and never a path: brig writes one directory of its own
and nowhere else, because that is the only place one of these files does
anything. Redirect ` + "`brig agent show`" + ` to put a copy anywhere of your own.

An agent entry saves you spelling out the image, the guest home and the
credential variables on every run. Copy the closest one and edit it. Building
an image for one is documented at
  ` + profile.BringYourOwnImageDoc + `

// confirmRemoveProfile names the files an rm is about to delete, and asks
// before deleting one the argument did not name.
//
// rm resolves the argument through the registry, which is what lets it work on
// an alias and on a file whose basename says nothing about the profile inside
// it. That resolution is also how `brig agent rm claude-code` could delete a
// file called mytool.yaml and exit 0 without a word: the file the person had a
// name for and the file brig found were different files, and only brig knew
// which.
//
// So the question is whether brig had to work anything out, and there are two
// ways it does. The argument may not be the profile's own name, which is the
// alias case: `brig agent rm claude` deletes whatever backs claude-code, and
// a file called claude.yaml declaring claude-code carries the stem the
// argument spells while being a profile the argument never said. And a file's
// basename may not be the argument at all, which is the renamed-by-hand case
// and the second-file-shadowing-the-first case. `brig agent rm mytool`
// against mytool.yaml declaring mytool is the one combination that is exactly
// what was typed -- what export writes, and the only case where nothing can
// surprise you.
//
// The message names every file profile.Remove will take rather than only the
// ones that raised the question: what is being agreed to is the delete, and a
// list one file short of it is the wrong thing to agree to.

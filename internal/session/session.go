// Package session turns a session name into the identifiers a run needs.

// Slug turns a session name into something safe to put in a path. It returns
// the empty string when the name holds no usable characters; the caller
// decides what to do about that.
//
// Nothing is shortened. A slug used to be cut to ten characters to keep a
// directory name short, and that cut is what made two long names one
// directory: the same guest home and the same sandbox for two sessions, with
// whichever credentials arrived last. A slug is now as long as the name makes
// it, and the only ceiling left is the filesystem's own limit on a path
// component.
//
// Sanitising still collapses names, which is a smaller class and not one a
// budget was ever protecting against: Foo, foo! and foo are all foo. That is
// what claimSlug refuses in internal/wrap -- see slugclaim.go.
//
// Replacing everything outside [A-Za-z0-9._-] is what makes this safe: it
// takes out every '/', so a slug holds no path separator and cannot escape
// its parent directory. Stripping leading dots and dashes then covers the two
// cosmetic hazards, a hidden directory and a name that reads as a flag.
//
// Lowercasing matters more than it looks: macOS filesystems ignore case by
// default, so Foo and foo name one directory. Without this they would also
// name two different microVMs, and both would write to that one directory.

# Command line reference

Every Brig verb and flag, the environment variables, the JSON output and the
exit codes, checked against the code that implements them. See
[quickstart.md](quickstart.md) for the walkthrough of a first run. Read this
page when you already know what you want and need the exact syntax.

Every old spelling still works for one more release. This page teaches only
the current one. [migration.md](migration.md) has the full old-to-new table
and the deprecation window.

## Everyday commands

The nine commands you type most, before the exhaustive reference below.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `brig run claude ~/code/demo` | starts the sandbox and runs the agent against that project |
| `brig run claude` | reruns the agent, remounting the project this session used last |
| `brig run claude@refactor ~/code/demo` | starts a second, independent session of the same agent |
| `brig sh claude` | opens a login shell inside the sandbox |
| `brig ls` | lists every sandbox, with its ref, state and guest home |
| `brig info claude` | prints the execution envelope, without booting anything |
| `brig stop claude` | stops the sandbox and keeps its state on disk |
| `brig rm claude` | stops the sandbox and removes it |
| `brig network publish claude 3000` | opens the agent's port 3000 on `localhost:3000` |

## Help

Every verb answers `--help`, `-h` and `brig help <verb>` with its own usage,
printed to stdout with a zero exit. The two spellings print the same text:

```bash
brig run --help
brig help run
```

`brig help` alone prints the command list and the flags the verbs share. A
word after the ref is still the agent's, so `brig run claude --help` passes
`--help` through to the agent rather than answering it.

## Verbs

### `brig run`

```bash
brig run claude ~/code/demo
```

Starts the sandbox if it is not already running, then runs the agent inside
it.

```
brig run <ref> [project] [args...]
```

- `<ref>` names the agent, and, with `@<label>`, a session of its own. See
  [The ref](#the-ref) below.
- `[project]` is a host directory. Brig mounts it read-write at
  `/work/<name>` and starts the agent there. See
  [The run line](#the-run-line-ref-project-and-the-agents-own-arguments).
- `[args...]` reach the agent untouched.

Name no project, and Brig remounts whatever this session ran with last:

```bash
brig run claude
```

Start a second, independent session of the same agent, with its own sandbox
and its own guest home:

```bash
brig run claude@refactor ~/code/demo
```

Start the sandbox and exit, without attaching:

```bash
brig run claude ~/code/demo -d
```

Run with no project mounted at all, even one this session ran with before:

```bash
brig run claude --no-project
```

Pass an argument through to the agent rather than have Brig read it. `--`
ends Brig's own parsing:

```bash
brig run claude ~/code/demo -- --version
```

### `brig sh`

```bash
brig sh claude
```

Opens a login shell inside the sandbox, starting it first if it is not
running.

```
brig sh <ref> [command...]
```

`sh` takes no project argument. The first bare word after the ref is already
the guest command:

```bash
brig sh claude ls /work
```

### `brig stop`

```bash
brig stop claude
```

Stops the sandbox and keeps its name and its state on disk. Stopping a
sandbox that is not running is not an error, because that is already the
state `stop` asks for.

### `brig rm`

```bash
brig rm claude
```

Stops the sandbox and removes it. When Brig created the guest home, because
the run named no `--home` or `BRIG_WORKSPACE`, `rm` deletes it too and prints
its path. A guest home you named and your project are host directories
Brig only mounted, so neither is touched, and `rm` prints the path of each
one it left behind.

If the sandbox is removed but its guest home cannot be deleted, `rm` exits
`1` and names the home. The sandbox stays removed, and the next run of the
session deletes what is left of the home before it boots.

```bash
brig rm --all
```

Stops and removes every sandbox Brig has. Before removing anything, it lists
each sandbox as its ref, sandbox name and state, one per line, and asks for
confirmation. If stdin is not a terminal, the command refuses, removes
nothing, and exits `1`. Pass `-y` (or `--yes`) to confirm in advance, for
example in a script. If there is nothing to remove, the command asks nothing
and exits `0`.

```bash
brig rm --all --dry-run
brig rm claude --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` prints what the command would remove and exits `0` without
removing anything. For `rm --all` this is the same list the prompt shows.
For `rm <ref>` it is the one sandbox, and the guest home it would delete or
leave. A ref
with no sandbox still exits `3`. `brig rm <ref>` asks no question, so it
refuses `-y`.

`rm` and `stop` each take exactly one ref. Neither takes a list of them.

### `brig ls`

```bash
brig ls
```

Lists every sandbox Brig knows about, one row each: `REF`, `SANDBOX` (the
runtime's name for it), `STATE` and `WORKSPACE` (the guest home).

```bash
brig ls -q
```

Prints refs only, one per line, and skips a row with no derivable ref. Every
line `-q` prints is a word another verb accepts.

### `brig logs`

```bash
brig logs claude --follow
```

Streams the sandbox's log.

```
brig logs <ref> [--follow] [--tail N] [--raw]
brig logs --gateway [<ref>]
```

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--follow` | keep streaming as new lines arrive |
| `--tail N` | show the last `N` lines. Default: `-1`, meaning every line |
| `--raw` | skip Brig's own formatting |
| `--gateway` | read the network gateway's log instead of the sandbox's own |

With no ref, `--gateway` reads the shared gateway that serves the default
network. With a ref, it reads that sandbox's own gateway log, which exists
only for a sandbox on `--network isolated` or one carrying a policy:

```bash
brig logs --gateway
brig logs --gateway claude
```

### `brig info`

```bash
brig info claude
```

Prints the execution envelope without booting anything. The envelope has the
sandbox name, the isolation, the guest home, the image, the verification
mode, the network, every published port and the credentials by name.

`info` fails only when a required secret cannot be resolved. A declared
secret marked `required: false` prints a warning, and the command still
exits `0`.

### `brig network`

```bash
brig network publish claude 3000      # the agent's dev server, on localhost:3000
brig network publish claude 8080:80   # host 8080 carries guest 80
brig network ls claude                # what this sandbox publishes
brig network unpublish claude 8080    # close it again
brig network unpublish claude --all
```

`publish` opens a guest port on the host of a sandbox that is already up, or
records it for the next boot of one that is not. `--publish` on `brig run`
asks for the same thing at boot. `ls` lists the ports and whether each is open
right now.

`brig info` prints the ports too, as the `PORTS` row of the execution
envelope. `ls` is the one to reach for when the ports are all you want: it
resolves no credentials, so it answers even when a declared secret is
missing.

A port is written the way docker writes one:

| Written | Means |
| --- | --- |
| `3000` | host `127.0.0.1:3000` carries guest `3000` |
| `8080:80` | host `127.0.0.1:8080` carries guest `80` |
| `127.0.0.1:8080:80` | the same, said explicitly |
| `0.0.0.0:8080:80` | offered to the network this host is on |
| `5353:53/udp` | UDP rather than TCP |

The host address defaults to `127.0.0.1`, so a published port is reachable
from this machine and not from the network this machine is on. `0.0.0.0` is
how you ask for the wider one, and the execution envelope says so on the row
for that port.

A publication belongs to the sandbox rather than to one run of it. `brig stop`
releases the host port, because nothing else on the machine could take it
otherwise, and keeps the publication: the next `brig run` offers the same
ports without being asked again. `brig network unpublish` is what takes one
away, and `brig rm` takes all of them with the sandbox.

`unpublish` names a port by its host side alone, which is the half you can
see. `brig network unpublish claude 8080` closes whatever `8080` was
carrying. The HOST column of `brig network ls` works as printed:
`brig network unpublish claude 0.0.0.0:8080` closes the port on that address
only.

Publishing needs a network gateway that brig owns, which is the `hvi` backend
on macOS. On `vz` the sandbox takes its network from vmnet and brig has
nothing to ask, so `--publish` is refused there by name rather than ignored.
On Linux the container runtime publishes, and it can only do that when the
sandbox is created: `brig run --publish` works, and publishing onto a sandbox
that is already running says to remove it and run it again.

### `brig doctor`

```bash
brig doctor
```

Checks, one line each: the brig build, the host, the hypervisor, the
runtime, the boot assets, cosign, the profile directory, the secret store and
brigd. The first line is the same build `brig version` prints, so a report
pasted whole says which binary produced it. A running brigd is asked which
build it is; one that differs from the brig binary is marked `!!` with a
restart as its fix, because a daemon left up across an upgrade serves the
old code with no other sign.

```bash
brig doctor claude
```

Fills in the image line, which is otherwise the one check doctor cannot make
without knowing which agent you mean. When the agent's profile names a
`runtimeBin`, the runtime and boot lines report on that binary, the one a
run of the agent drives, rather than the one on `PATH`.

```bash
brig doctor --json
```

Prints the same checks as a JSON array, each with `name`, `state`, `finding`
and, when the check failed, `fix`.

Only two checks gate the exit status: a missing or broken runtime, and a
secret store that will not open. Every other finding, including one marked
`!!`, prints its fix and leaves the exit status at `0`.

### `brig version`

```bash
brig version
```

Prints the version and, in parentheses, the build it came from: the short
commit, the commit date, the Go version and the platform. `--version` is the
same command.

```
brig v0.2.0 (131e3bc, 2026-09-15, go1.26.0, darwin/arm64)
```

The version is what Go derived from the nearest tag when the binary was
built. A release prints its tag. A build from a commit after a tag prints a
pseudo-version naming that commit, such as
`v0.2.1-0.20260915210404-ef4aa8b0efb6`, with `+dirty` appended when the tree
had uncommitted changes. A build with no git history behind it, such as one
from a source tarball, prints `dev` and no commit.

`--json` prints the same build under the envelope, with the commit in full.
`commit` and `commitTime` are absent when the build carried no git history.

```bash
brig version --json
```

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "brig.sh/v1alpha1",
  "kind": "Version",
  "data": {
    "version": "v0.2.0",
    "commit": "131e3bc5615df5ff74e6b5af9a5bcf2ed42b1d57",
    "commitTime": "2026-09-15T09:36:19Z",
    "modified": false,
    "goVersion": "go1.26.0",
    "os": "darwin",
    "arch": "arm64"
  }
}
```

### `brig completion`

```bash
brig completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_brig"
```

Prints a completion script for `bash`, `zsh` or `fish` to stdout. Nothing is
installed for you. See [completions.md](completions.md) for where each shell
reads its script from, and exactly what completes where.

### `brig agent`

```bash
brig agent ls
```

Lists the agents you can run.

```
brig agent ls
brig agent show <agent>
brig agent new <name> --from <agent> [--force]
brig agent edit <name>
brig agent rm <name>
brig agent import <file>
brig agent export <agent> [name] [--force]
```

Copy a built-in agent under a name of your own, then edit the copy:

```bash
brig agent new mine --from claude
brig agent edit mine
```

A built-in agent has no file of its own until `new` gives it one. Print an
agent, to read it or pipe it:

```bash
brig agent show claude-code
```

`export` is the alternative to `new --from`: same result, the other
direction. Save a copy of an agent you did not create, under a name you
choose:

```bash
brig agent export claude-code mine
```

Add a file you wrote or received:

```bash
brig agent import mine.yaml
```

Delete a file-backed agent, after asking:

```bash
brig agent rm mine
```

`--force` (or `-f`) with `new` or `export` overwrites a destination file that
already exists. Without it, Brig refuses and names the file. `--json` with
`show`, `new` or `export` prints the document as JSON instead
of YAML, with no envelope. See [`--json` output](#--json-output) below.
[profiles.md](profiles.md) is the reference for the file format.

### `brig policy`

```bash
brig policy ls
```

Lists every policy, and what binds it.

```
brig policy ls
brig policy create <name>
brig policy edit <name>
brig policy show <name>
brig policy rm <name>
brig policy attach <policy> <agent> [-n <label>]
brig policy detach <policy> <agent> [-n <label>]
brig policy check <agent> [-n <label>]
```

Write a starter policy, then open it:

```bash
brig policy create locked-down
```

Bind it to every run of an agent:

```bash
brig policy attach locked-down claude
```

Bind it to one session instead of every run:

```bash
brig policy attach locked-down claude -n refactor
```

Confirm what is bound to a run, and whether Brig can enforce it:

```bash
brig policy check claude
```

[policies.md](policies.md) covers the document format and what each network
posture means.

### `brig secret`

```bash
brig secret create gh-token
```

Reads the value from stdin and stores it under that name in your keyring.

```
brig secret create <name> [-f FILE]
brig secret update <name> [-f FILE]
brig secret read <name>
brig secret delete <name>
brig secret ls
brig secret import <agent>
brig secret import <agent> <name>
```

Fill every secret an agent's profile declares, from your host, once:

```bash
brig secret import claude-code
```

Fill one of them:

```bash
brig secret import claude-code gh-token
```

The value is never a command-line argument, so it never appears in `ps` or
in your shell history. See [secrets.md](secrets.md) for the store,
provenance and the sources a profile can declare.

### `brig telemetry`

```bash
brig telemetry status
```

Reports whether usage data is sent, and what decided the answer.

```bash
brig telemetry off
```

Turns it off, durably, on this machine. See [telemetry.md](telemetry.md) for
what is counted, what is never collected, and how the answer is stored.

## The ref

A ref is `<agent>` or `<agent>@<label>`. An empty label is the agent's
default session, so `claude` and `claude@refactor` are two sessions of one
agent, never two agents. See [sessions.md](sessions.md) for what a session
keeps separate, and what survives which command.

The separator is exactly one `@`. Brig refuses a ref instead of rewriting
it:

| Written | Refused because |
| --- | --- |
| `claude@@x` | more than one `@` |
| `@refactor` | no agent named before the `@` |
| `claude@` | a trailing `@` names no session. Drop it for the default session, or name one |
| `claude@Refactor` | the label is not already clean. Labels use lowercase letters, digits, dot, dash and underscore |

A label is never rewritten for you. The label reaches two places that must
agree on it: the sandbox name and the guest home directory. A label that
needs cleaning up first is refused rather than silently changed.

## The run line: ref, project, and the agent's own arguments

`brig run <ref> [project] [args...]` reads three kinds of token from one
line, told apart by position and count, never by the filesystem:

1. The first bare word is the ref.
2. On `run` only, the second bare word is a project directory. Brig mounts
   it read-write at `/work/<basename>` and starts the agent there.
3. The next bare word, or anything after `--`, is the agent's own argument.

The directory named as the project must exist. Brig does not read a bare
word as a project only when a directory of that name happens to exist. An
argument's meaning does not depend on the filesystem. A directory that is
not there is an error rather than a silent fallback to the agent's argv.

`--` ends Brig's own parsing outright. No word after it is ever read as a
project, and a project already read before the marker stands:

```bash
brig run claude ~/code/demo -- --version
```

Brig's own flags keep being read after the ref and after the project,
because both are Brig's own operands too:

```bash
brig run claude ~/code/demo --mem 4096 -d
```

Only `run` takes a project this way. `brig sh claude ~/code/demo` reads
`~/code/demo` as the start of the guest command, not as a directory to
mount.

## Flag placement

A Brig line has two positions for Brig's own flags. Global flags stand left
of the verb. Run-line flags stand between the verb and wherever the agent's
own arguments begin.

| Position | Flags |
| --- | --- |
| Global | `--verbose`, `-q`/`--quiet`, `--json` |
| Run-line | `--image`, `--home`, `--mem`, `--cpus`, `--no-project`, `-d`/`--detach`, `--skills`, `--network`, `--offline`, `--publish`, and, as peers, `-q`/`--quiet` and `--json` |

The global position is a closed set. A token there that is none of the three
global flags is refused by name, never forwarded to an agent:

```
brig: unknown flag "--nope" before the command. brig takes a command first:
`brig run claude`, `brig ls`. If "--nope" is the agent's, it goes after the
profile
```

Exactly two flags are accepted in both positions, and they behave
differently:

| Flag | After the verb, on the run line |
| --- | --- |
| `-q`/`--quiet` | still works this release, and prints one deprecation notice moving it left. See [migration.md](migration.md) |
| `--json` | a permanent peer spelling. No notice, either position |

```bash
brig info claude --json
brig --json info claude
```

Both print the same report, and neither is deprecated.

An unrecognized flag before the ref is refused by name, because there is no
agent yet to hand it to (a help flag there is a help request, not a mistake --
see [Help](#help)):

```
brig: unknown flag "--nope" before the profile name. brig's own flags come
before the profile and the agent's after it; put "--nope" after the profile
to pass it through, or -- to end brig's flags
```

The same spelling after the ref reaches the agent untouched. Brig names one
of its own flags found past that point, without taking it, so a working line
keeps working:

```bash
brig run claude -p hi --quiet
```

runs the agent with `-p hi --quiet` and warns that `--quiet` looked like
Brig's own flag but stood where the agent's arguments already begin.

### Run-line flags

| Flag | Value | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--image IMAGE` | image ref | the agent's own | guest image to boot |
| `--home PATH` | host directory | the agent's own guest home | mounted as the agent's home. Replaces `--workspace`, see [migration.md](migration.md). The environment variable is still `BRIG_WORKSPACE`. There is no `BRIG_HOME` |
| `--mem MB` | number | the agent's own (`4096` for most shipped agents) | guest memory |
| `--cpus N` | number | the agent's own (`4` for most shipped agents) | guest vCPUs |
| `--no-project` | (none) | off | mount no project this run, even one this session ran with before. On any verb but `run`, refused by name as a usage error |
| `-d`, `--detach` | (none) | off | start the sandbox and exit, without attaching. Parses on every verb, but only `run` reads it. On `sh`, `stop`, `rm` and `info` it is silently inert |
| `--skills` | (none) | off | copy your own `~/.claude` skills and plugins into the guest home. The host copy is never written. Same as `BRIG_SKILLS=1` |
| `--network MODE` | `shared`, `isolated` or `offline` | the posture this sandbox was started with, then the agent's own profile `network:` (none of the shipped agents set one), then `shared` | the sandbox's network posture. A sandbox keeps its posture, so a verb without the flag does not change it. See [policies.md](policies.md) |
| `--offline` | (none) | off | shorthand for `--network offline`: the agent runs with its guest home, and nothing leaves the sandbox |
| `--publish PORT` | `3000`, `8080:80`, `127.0.0.1:8080:80`, `5353:53/udp` | nothing published | open a guest port on the host. Repeatable. Binds to `127.0.0.1` unless the address says otherwise. There is no `-p`: that is the agent's. See [`brig network`](#brig-network) |

Flag beats an environment setting beats the profile's own field, in that
order, for every value above with an `env` counterpart in
[Environment variables](#environment-variables) below.

`--mem` and `--cpus` take a positive whole number. Anything else, including
`0`, is refused by name rather than silently rounded or ignored.

## `--json` output

The set of verbs that accept `--json` is larger than `brig --help`'s own
summary line suggests. It also splits by where the flag stands, not only by
verb.

| Verb | Where `--json` is accepted | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ls` | global, or local after `ls` | envelope |
| `info`, `env` | global, or local on the run line | envelope |
| `doctor` | global, or local after `doctor` | envelope |
| `version` | global, or local after `version` | envelope |
| `network ls`, `network publish`, `network unpublish` | global, or local after the ref | envelope, `kind: Ports` |
| `run`, `sh` | global, or local on the run line | one compact line, see below |
| `agent ls` | global, or local after `ls` | envelope |
| `secret ls` | global, or local after `ls` | envelope |
| `agent show`, `agent export`, `agent new` | local only, after the subcommand | bare document, no envelope |
| `policy show` | local only, after the subcommand | bare document, no envelope |

"Global" means left of the verb: `brig --json ls`. "Local" means the flag
stands after the subcommand, on either side of that subcommand's own
operand: `brig agent show claude-code --json` and
`brig agent show --json claude-code` both work.

`agent` accepts `--json` in the global position only when its subverb is
`ls`. `policy` never does, on any subverb. So the global spelling refuses
both `agent show` and `policy show`, even though each has a local `--json`
that works:

```
brig --json agent show claude-code
brig: `brig agent` has no --json output. --json is for the read verbs: ls,
info, agent ls, secret ls, doctor, version and the network verbs (env takes
it too, but env is deprecated; prefer info), and for run and sh
```

The flag has to follow `agent show`, not precede `agent`. Every verb not
listed in the table above refuses `--json` in both positions, naming the
verbs that do accept it. `env` is the deprecated spelling of `info` and
takes the flag on the same terms. Prefer `info`.

**Envelope shape.** A list or report verb prints
`{"apiVersion": "brig.sh/v1alpha1", "kind": "...", "data": ...}`. Within one
`apiVersion`, a field is only ever added, never renamed or removed, so a
script written against it keeps parsing as Brig grows. No field carries a
credential value, names only.

**Bare shape.** `agent show`, `agent export`, `agent new` and `policy show`
print the document itself, with no envelope. Each renders a file meant to
be saved and read back by Brig:

```bash
brig agent show claude-code --json
```

```json
{
  "name": "claude-code",
  "desc": "Claude Code (Anthropic)",
  "binary": "claude",
  ...
}
```

**The network verbs under `--json`.** All three print what the sandbox
publishes, after whatever the command changed, as `kind: Ports`:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "brig.sh/v1alpha1",
  "kind": "Ports",
  "data": {
    "sandbox": "brig-claude-code",
    "ports": [
      {"host": "127.0.0.1:8080", "guest": 80, "protocol": "tcp", "live": true}
    ]
  }
}
```

`live` is whether the gateway is forwarding that port this moment. A port
recorded but not live belongs to a sandbox that is not running, and it is
published again when that sandbox starts.

It is `null`, and `STATE` reads `unknown`, on a runtime brig cannot ask. The
Linux runtime answers nothing here, so a port it forwards reports neither open
nor pending until it does.

**`run` and `sh` under `--json`.** The agent runs as a child of Brig. After
it exits, Brig prints one compact JSON line with the outcome, the last line
of stdout:

```json
{"apiVersion":"brig.sh/v1alpha1","kind":"Run","data":{"ref":"claude","sandbox":"brig-claude-code","stage":"agent","exit":0}}
```

`data.stage` is one of four values. `"brig"` means a refusal before the
agent ran. `"agent"` means an agent that ran. `"gui"` means a windowed
agent. `"detached"` applies under `-d`. `data.exit` is the agent's own exit
status when `stage` is `"agent"`, and one of Brig's own exit codes
otherwise. See [Exit codes](#exit-codes) for what those carve-outs mean for
a script.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | success |
| `1` | a general failure |
| `2` | a usage error: an unknown flag, a stray argument, or a value in the wrong place, as reported by the verb's own parser |
| `3` | no such thing: an unknown agent, or a sandbox that is not there |
| `4` | no usable runtime: none installed, an unknown `BRIG_RUNTIME`, or `BRIG_RUNTIME_BIN` (or a profile's own `runtimeBin`) pointing at nothing. The refusal names the setting that caused it |
| `5` | a boot refused over image verification |
| `6` | a required secret was not resolved, or the secret store did not open |

This table is asserted end to end by `script/smoke.sh` and
`cmd/brig/exit_test.go`, and is the one [docs/stability.md](stability.md)
calls stable enough to script against.

**6 is for required secrets only.** A declared secret marked
`required: false` produces a warning, not a failure. `claude-code`'s two
secrets are both optional, so `brig info claude` with neither one set exits
`0`.

**Two carve-outs under `run --json` and `sh --json`.** The agent runs as a
child of Brig. Its own exit status becomes Brig's, read ahead of every
class above. An exit `3` from `brig --json run claude` can be the agent's
own `3`, not Brig's "no such agent".

Branch on the `Run` object's `data.stage` field, not on the number alone.
`"agent"` means the code is the agent's. Anything else means it is one of
the classes in the table.

Separately, a Brig refusal under `--json` is written to stdout as the `Run`
object, the same place as every success case, never to stderr.

**A handful of usage mistakes exit `1` instead of `2`.** These currently
return a plain error, not the usage type, so they exit `1`:

- an unknown top-level command
- a run-line verb given no ref
- a missing subcommand on `agent`, `policy` or `secret`
- `secret import` or `policy check` given no agent

```
brig nosuchverb
brig: unknown command "nosuchverb" (try `brig help`)
```

```
brig run
brig: run needs a profile, for example `brig run claude`. `brig agent ls`
lists them
```

Both exit `1`, while the same class of mistake on `brig ls extra` or
`brig completion bogus` exits `2`. To tell a usage mistake apart from a
general failure here, check for a nonzero status, not for exactly `2`.

A bare `brig telemetry` is not one of these. `telemetry` defaults to
`status` with no subcommand and exits `0`. `agent`, `policy` and `secret`
are the three that refuse a bare invocation.

## Environment variables

Most settings below are read through `BRIG_<KEY>` and also honor
`BRIG_<AGENT>_<KEY>`. The agent-specific form wins when both are set, so one
shell can carry a different value per agent. The agent name is upper-cased
with dashes turned to underscores, so `claude-code` reads
`BRIG_CLAUDE_CODE_MEM` ahead of `BRIG_MEM`.

A handful of settings have no per-agent form. Brig reads each once for the
invocation, not per run: the directories, the runtime choice, the
boot-asset and gateway paths, and `BRIG_ENV_ARGV`. Each is marked "global
only" below.

### Sandbox and profile locations

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BRIG_WORKSPACE` | `~/.brig/homes/<sandbox>` | host directory mounted as the guest home. A named session appends `-<slug>` to one you set. Brig deletes the default one on `brig rm`, and never deletes one you set |
| `BRIG_NAME` | `brig-<agent>` | the sandbox's own name. Must begin with `brig-`, or `brig ls` and `brig rm --all` cannot find it. A named session appends `-<slug>` |
| `BRIG_PROFILE_DIR` (global only) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/brig` | where your own agent files live. `BRIG_TEMPLATE_DIR` still works for one release |
| `BRIG_POLICY_DIR` (global only) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/brig/policies` | where policy files live |
| `BRIG_STATE_DIR` (global only) | `~/.brig` | where Brig keeps what has to outlive one command, including the project each sandbox last ran with |

### Guest resources and network

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BRIG_IMAGE` | the agent's own | guest image to boot |
| `BRIG_PULL` | `missing` | `missing` pulls only when the image is not already on the host. `always` re-pulls every run. `never` refuses to boot an image that is not already there |
| `BRIG_MEM` | the agent's own | guest memory, MB |
| `BRIG_CPUS` | the agent's own | guest vCPUs |
| `BRIG_READY_TIMEOUT` | `30` | seconds to wait for the in-guest agent once the runtime reports the sandbox running. The two are not the same moment |
| `BRIG_NETWORK` | `shared` | `shared`, `isolated` or `offline`. Beats the posture the sandbox was started with. An unrecognized value refuses the run. See [policies.md](policies.md) |
| `BRIG_SKILLS` | `0` | `1` copies your own `~/.claude` skills and plugins into the guest home. Same as `--skills` |
| `BRIG_FORWARD_ENV` | (unset) | a space-separated list of environment variable names to carry into the guest, read live on every run |
| `BRIG_TITLE` | the agent's own | window title for a graphical agent |

`BRIG_FORWARD_ENV` replaces only a profile's own `env:` bindings that
declare the singular `ref: env.<name>` form. It leaves a binding that names
its source through a `refs:` chain untouched, even one whose chain includes
an `env.` entry. A name the profile binds from somewhere else, `secrets.` or
a literal `value:`, is dropped from the override rather than layered onto
it. Brig warns about each one it drops. The profile's own binding wins,
because the profile is what you wrote.

### Credentials and Git

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BRIG_ALLOW_REFS` | `0` | `1` forwards a value that still looks like an unresolved `scheme://` secret reference |
| `BRIG_ALLOW_DENIED` | `0` | `1` forwards a variable on the agent's own billing denylist |
| `BRIG_GIT_CONFIG` | `0` | `1` writes a credential helper and gitconfig into the guest, routing an SSH GitHub remote over HTTPS |
| `BRIG_GIT_HOSTS` | `github.com` | space-separated hosts the forwarded token applies to |
| `BRIG_GIT_USER` | resolved on the host | username paired with the forwarded token |
| `BRIG_GIT_IDENTITY` | `1` | `0` stops Brig from forwarding the host commit identity resolved from the invoking directory |
| `BRIG_GIT_NAME`, `BRIG_GIT_EMAIL` | the host's `git config` | override that identity |
| `BRIG_TRUST_WORKSPACE` | `1` | pre-answers the agent's own "do you trust this folder" question for the directory a run starts in |
| `BRIG_ENV_ARGV` (global only) | (unset) | exactly `1` puts a forwarded value on the runtime's own command line, where `ps` can read it. Never applies to a value Brig resolved itself, such as a stored secret; those stay off the command line regardless |

[authentication.md](authentication.md) and [secrets.md](secrets.md) cover
what each of these does with the credential once it is in the guest.

### Image verification

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BRIG_VERIFY` | `warn` | `warn`, `require` or `off`. `strict` is an alias for `require`, and `none` and `0` both alias `off`. An unrecognized value refuses the run rather than falling back to `warn` |
| `BRIG_VERIFY_REGISTRY` | `ghcr.io/brig-sh/` | image prefix treated as Brig's own, so a signature is expected |
| `BRIG_VERIFY_IDENTITY` | Brig's own community-images build workflow | certificate identity regexp cosign must match |
| `BRIG_VERIFY_ISSUER` | GitHub Actions OIDC | certificate OIDC issuer |
| `BRIG_COSIGN_BIN` | `cosign` on `PATH` | path to the cosign binary |

`warn` reports an unverifiable image and boots anyway, and also stops to ask
about an image that claims to be Brig's own and is not. `require` refuses to
boot anything it cannot positively verify, cosign missing included. See
[security.md](security.md) for what verification does and does not catch.

### Runtime and hypervisor

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BRIG_RUNTIME` (global only) | `hull` on macOS, `nerdctl` on Linux | which runtime to drive |
| `BRIG_RUNTIME_BIN` (global only) | `hull` on the `hull` runtime, `nerdctl` then `docker` on the `nerdctl` runtime, each found on `PATH` | path to that binary. `BRIG_RUNTIME` picks the runtime first, and this only overrides its executable |
| `BRIG_HYPERVISOR` | the agent's own `hypervisor:` field, else `vz` | macOS only: `vz`, `hvi` or `qemu`. Wins over the agent's own field when set |
| `BRIG_ROOTFS_TYPE` | the agent's own `rootfsType:` field | `block`, `virtiofs` or `9pfs`, how the guest root reaches the microVM under `hull`. `nerdctl` ignores it. A profile's own `rootfsType:` outside that set is refused when the profile loads, but this variable is passed to `hull` unchecked |
| `BRIG_CONTAINERD_RUNTIME` (global only) | `io.containerd.urunc.v2` | Linux only, on the `nerdctl` runtime: the containerd shim that boots the sandbox as a microVM. A different shim, for example one that runs a plain container, gives up that isolation |

`hvi` is the only backend that enforces an attached egress policy or
`--network isolated`, and it needs macOS 15 or newer. `vz` is the only
backend with a graphical console. On macOS 14, set `BRIG_HYPERVISOR=vz` to
run at all, since Brig refuses an `hvi` run there rather than falling back
on its own. See [runtimes.md](runtimes.md).

### Boot assets and the network gateway

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BRIG_BOOT_ASSETS` (global only) | on macOS, wherever `hull assets dir` says (`~/.hull/assets` if hull cannot answer); `$XDG_DATA_HOME/brig/assets` on Linux | directory holding the host kernel and initrd a `genericBoot` agent needs |
| `BRIG_BOOT_ASSETS_REF` (global only) | `ghcr.io/nofireai/hull-assets:<os>-<arch>` | the bundle Brig fetches when the boot assets are missing |
| `BRIG_GATEWAY_SOCK` (global only) | `<gateway dir>/gateway-<subnet>.sock` | control socket of the shared network gateway |
| `BRIG_GATEWAY_DIR` (global only) | the directory of `BRIG_GATEWAY_SOCK`, else `~/.brig` | where every gateway socket and log lives, shared and per-sandbox alike |
